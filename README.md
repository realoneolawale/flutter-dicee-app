ðŸŒŸ 100 Days of Code: Flutter Developer Journey ðŸŒŸ

Day 3: #100DaysOfCode challenge continues! ðŸš€ Today, I learnt the core programming concept that forms the foundation of most Flutter apps, using setState() inside Stateful widgets ðŸ’»âœ¨

Agenda included:
1. How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
2. How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
3. How to change the properties of various widgets.
4. How to use onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
5. How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
6. How to use Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
7. Understand and use string interpolation.
8. Learning about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
9. Code and use gesture controls.

After all these, I made "Dicee" ðŸŽ², a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button.
